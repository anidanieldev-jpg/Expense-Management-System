# Managing Vendors

Vendors are the people or companies you buy from. Properly managing your list of vendors is the first step to tracking where your money goes.

## 1. Adding a New Vendor
1.  Navigate to the **Vendors** tab in the sidebar.
2.  Click the blue **"Add Vendor"** button at the top right.
3.  Fill in the form:
    - **Vendor Name**: (Required) e.g., "Mama Favor".
    - **Address**: (Optional) Current location or shop address.
    - **Phone**: (Optional) Contact number.
4.  Click **Save**. The vendor will appear in your list.

## 2. Viewing a Vendor's Profile
Click on any vendor row to open their profile. A panel will slide out showing:
- **Contact Info**: Address and phone.
- **Total Outstanding Debt**: A large red summary of how much you owe them across all unpaid bills.
- **Unpaid Invoices**: A list of specific bills that are waiting for payment.

## 3. Editing or Deleting
- **To Edit**: Hover over the vendor row and click the **Pencil Icon**. Change the details and click Save.
- **To Delete**: Hover over the vendor row and click the **Trash Icon**. Confirm the deletion.
  > **Note**: Deleting a vendor will NOT delete their expenses, but those expenses fits be orphaned. It is recommended to settle all debts before deleting a vendor.
