# Wallets & Payments

This is where you manage your cash flow. You cannot make a payment unless you have money in a wallet.

## 1. Setting Up Wallets
A "Wallet" acts like a bank account or cash drawers.
1.  Go to **Wallets**.
2.  Click **"Add Wallet"**.
3.  Enter a name (e.g., "GTBank", "Petty Cash") and the Opening Balance.
4.  **Transaction History**: Clicking on a wallet card will now show a complete history of all money flow:
    *   <span style="color:red">**Payments**</span> (Money Out): Marked with a minus sign (-).
    *   <span style="color:green">**Deposits**</span> (Money In): Marked with a plus sign (+).

## 2. Recording a Transfer
We have unified the process for sending money out and bringing money in. Go to **Payments** and click **"Record Transfer"**.

### Mode A: Out (Pay) - Making Payments
