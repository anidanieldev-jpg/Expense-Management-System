# Tracking Expenses

An "Expense" in this system represents a bill or an invoice given to you by a vendor.

## 1. Recording a New Expense
1.  Navigate to the **Expenses** tab.
2.  Click **"New Expense"**.
3.  Fill in the form:
    - **Vendor**: Select who issued the bill.
    - **Date**: When was the bill issued? (Defaults to today).
    - **Amount (₦)**: The total value of the items bought.
    - **Category**: Group the expense (e.g., "Feed", "Logistics").
    - **Description**: Add notes (e.g., "5 bags of broiler starter").
4.  Click **Save**.

## 2. Statuses
Every expense has a status that updates automatically:
- **Unpaid**: You owe the full amount.
- **Partial**: You have paid some, but not all.
- **Paid**: You have fully settled this bill.

## 3. Viewing Balance Due
In the main list, the **"Balance"** column shows exactly how much is left to pay.
- If the text is **Red**, you still owe money.
- If the text is **Green ($0.00)**, the bill is cleared.
