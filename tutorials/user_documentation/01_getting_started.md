# Getting Started

## 1. Launching the Application
To use the Expense Manager:
1.  Double-click `control_panel.bat` in the project folder.
2.  Click **▶ Start System** in the control panel.
3.  Once the servers are running, click **Open App ↗** or go to `http://localhost:8000`.

## 2. The Dashboard Layout
When you open an application, you will see a clean, split-screen interface:

### Sidebar (Left)
This is your main navigation hub.
- **Expenses**: View all your bills and invoices.
- **Payments Made**: View history of all money sent out.
- **Vendors**: Manage your list of suppliers.
- **Wallets**: Manage your funding sources.

### Viewport (Center)
This area changes based on what you select in the sidebar. It usually displays a list of records (e.g., a list of expenses).

### Detail Panel (Right - Hidden by Default)
When you click on any row in the main list, a panel slides in from the right. This panel shows detailed information about that specific item (e.g., a Vendor's full profile and transaction history).

## 3. General Navigation Tips
- **Click a Row**: Opens the details for that item.
- **Hover**: Hover your mouse over a row to reveal "Edit" (Pencil) and "Delete" (Trash) icons.
- **New Button**: The large blue button at the top right is always for creating a new record for the current section.
